### M-TREAT Full-Stack Developer Takeaway Assessment

**Summary:**
This assessment evaluates your ability to build and integrate a patient registration and authentication system using React, Redux, Django, and PostgreSQL. You will create a simple, full-stack solution demonstrating data flow between the frontend and backend.

**Requirements:**

-   Use React for the frontend, powered by Redux for state management.
-   Implement a Django backend with a REST API to handle requests.
-   Utilize PostgreSQL for database management.
-   Ensure React is served by the Django server(No need to use React serve when the Django server is live).

**Tasks:**

1. Patient Registration:
    - Create a frontend form for patient registration (e.g., name, email, phone, password).
    - Send registration data to the Django backend and store it in the PostgreSQL database.
    - Validate input fields on both frontend and backend.
2. User Authentication:
    - Implement login functionality with token-based authentication using Djangoâ€™s authentication framework.
    - Store and manage authentication tokens in Redux.
    - Ensure proper error handling for invalid credentials.
3. Patient Data Retrieval & Update:
   _ After logging in, display patient information (e.g., name, email) on a
   dashboard. Users can update other fields except email address.
   _ Fetch data from the PostgreSQL database through the Django API.

## Setup Instructions

### Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

    ```sh
    cd backend/app
    ```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:

    ```sh
    poetry install
    ```

3. Apply database migrations:

    ```sh
    poetry run prisma migrate dev --name init
    ```

4. Start the Django server:
    ```sh
    poetry run python manage.py runserver
    ```

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

    ```sh
    cd frontend/app
    ```

2. Install dependencies using npm:

    ```sh
    deno install
    ```

3. Start the Vite development server:
    ```sh
    deno task dev
    ```

## Usage

1. Register a new user through the frontend registration form.
2. Log in using the registered credentials.
3. View and update user details on the home page.
